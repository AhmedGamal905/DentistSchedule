    <h1>Insurance & Pricing</h1>
    <p>We'll work with you each step of the way to demystify the cost of care.</p>
    <h3>We Accept Most PPO Dental Plans</h3>
    <p>When you book an appointment, we’ll ask for you to send along your dental insurance information. This allows us to verify your benefits and give you a heads-up on the anticipated out-of-pocket costs for any procedures we prescribe. That's tricky to do on short notice—the sooner you get us your dental insurance information, the more accurately we can estimate your coverage.</p>

    <p>Here are some typical costs, if you don't have any insurance, for common procedures:</p>
